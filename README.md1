# Transactional Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project implements a **transactional fraud detection system** using Python. The system processes transaction data, detects anomalies, and identifies fraudulent activities leveraging machine learning models. It is designed for scalability, real-time processing, and ease of use.

---

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles raw transaction data cleaning and normalization.
- **Machine Learning-Based Detection**: Utilizes trained models for fraud prediction.
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Allows customization of anomaly detection parameters.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Logs system activity and errors for debugging and audit purposes.
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns for easier maintenance and scalability.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/transactional-fraud-detection.git
   cd transactional-fraud-detection
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir data logs models
   ```

4. Add your raw transaction data to `data/raw/sample_data.csv`.

---

## Usage

### Running the Application
To start the fraud detection system, execute:
```bash
python app.py
```

### Output
The system will:
1. Log activity to `logs/system.log`.
2. Detect fraud and summarize results in the console.

---

## Configuration
Customize settings in `config.py`:
- **Data Paths**: Define locations for raw and processed data.
- **Thresholds**: Adjust the anomaly score threshold for fraud detection.
- **Logging Level**: Set logging verbosity (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`).

---

## Development

### Training a Model
1. Add labeled data to `data/raw/sample_data.csv`.
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python models/train_model.py
   ```
3. The trained model will be saved to `models/model.pkl`.

### Testing
Add unit tests to `tests/` and run:
```bash
pytest
```

---

## Limitations
- **Data Dependency**: Requires sufficient labeled data for accurate predictions.
- **Model Bias**: Performance depends on training data quality and balance.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with live transaction systems.
- Deployment using Docker and Kubernetes.
- Real-time alerting via email or messaging APIs.

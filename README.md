Transactional Fraud Detection System

Overview

This project implements a transactional fraud detection system using Python. The system processes transaction data, detects anomalies, and identifies fraudulent activities leveraging machine learning models. It is designed for scalability, real-time processing, and ease of use.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles raw transaction data cleaning and normalization.

Machine Learning-Based Detection: Utilizes trained models for fraud prediction.

Configurable Thresholds: Allows customization of anomaly detection parameters.

Logging and Monitoring: Logs system activity and errors for debugging and audit purposes.

Modular Design: Clear separation of concerns for easier maintenance and scalability.

Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher

Pip (Python package manager)

Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/indraneel010/transactional-fraud-detection.git
cd transactional-fraud-detection

Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare directories:

mkdir data logs models

Add your raw transaction data to data/raw/sample_data.csv.

Usage

Running the Application

To start the fraud detection system, execute:

python app.py

Output

The system will:

Log activity to logs/system.log.

Detect fraud and summarize results in the console.

Configuration

Customize settings in config.py:

Data Paths: Define locations for raw and processed data.

Thresholds: Adjust the anomaly score threshold for fraud detection.

Logging Level: Set logging verbosity (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).

Development

Training a Model

Add labeled data to data/raw/sample_data.csv.

Train the model:

python models/train_model.py

The trained model will be saved to models/model.pkl.

Testing

Add unit tests to tests/ and run:

pytest

Limitations

Data Dependency: Requires sufficient labeled data for accurate predictions.

Model Bias: Performance depends on training data quality and balance.

Future Enhancements

Integration with live transaction systems.

Deployment using Docker and Kubernetes.

Real-time alerting via email or messaging APIs.
